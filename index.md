# Ansatz Analytica Points System

The *Ansatz Analytica Points System (AAPS)* is an alternative method for evaluating team performance and predicting outcomes in football (soccer), combining statistical smoothing, probabilistic inference, and customized scoring rules. Designed to enhance predictive accuracy and account for contextual variability across matches and leagues, AAPS provides a dynamic and adaptive framework for understanding team strength over time.

## Overview

Unlike traditional point systems that use static values (e.g., 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw), AAPS introduces weighted and probabilistic approaches to measuring performance. It leverages a combination of **Bayesian smoothing**, **exponential smoothing**, and **negative binomial modeling** to produce team performance metrics and goal-scoring probabilities.

## Core Methodology

### Smoothing Techniques

**1. Exponential Smoothing**  
AAPS uses exponential smoothing to give more weight to recent match results:

`Smoothed Value = α * current_value + (1 - α) * previous_smoothed_value`

**2. Bayesian Smoothing**  
Bayesian smoothing blends prior knowledge with actual data, ideal for small sample sizes:
- For rate smoothing:
  `smoothed = (prior_mean * prior_weight + sample_mean * sample_size) / (prior_weight + sample_size)`
- For binary outcomes: similar structure using success rates.

## Match Metrics Considered

- Goals scored and conceded
- Games scored (binary)
- Clean sheets (binary)
- Total games played

## Venue-Aware Point System

| Outcome | Home Points | Away Points |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Win     | 3           | 4           |
| Draw    | 1           | 2           |
| Loss    | -1          | 0           |

## Smoothed Performance Ratios

Each match is associated with a max point based on venue. The ratio is:
`Performance Ratio = Smoothed Points / Smoothed Max Points`

Computed for home, away, and overall.

## Expected Goals (λ)

λ is derived from:
- Team’s smoothed goal scoring rate
- Opponent’s smoothed conceding rate
- Score probability & clean sheet odds
- League & venue multipliers

## Goal Prediction Model

### Negative Binomial Distribution  
Accounts for variance:
```
r = 1/α,  p = 1 / (1 + α * μ)
P(X=k) = C(k + r - 1, k) * p^r * (1-p)^k
```

### Poisson Fallback  
```
P(X=k) = (λ^k * e^-λ) / k!
```

Probabilities are normalized over 0–10 goals.

## League Calibration

- League-specific priors
- Contextual multipliers for scoring trends

## Comparison Table

| Feature                    | Traditional | Elo | FIFA | AAPS |
|---------------------------|-------------|-----|------|------|
| Venue-aware               | No          | No  | Partial | Yes |
| Recency weighting         | No          | Yes | No     | Yes |
| Probabilistic modeling    | No          | No  | No     | Yes |
| League/context adjustment | No          | Partial | Yes | Yes |

## Practical Example

Team A is unbeatable at home but fragile away.  
Team B is steady at home and away.  
Both sit mid-table.

In a match where Team A is away and Team B is at home:
- Team A has 0.35 performance ratio (away)
- Team B has 0.70 performance ratio (home)

**AAPS clearly favors Team B**, while the traditional table offers no such insight.

## Use Cases

- Sports betting models
- Team power rankings
- AI-based simulations and predictions

## Summary

AAPS blends exponential and Bayesian smoothing with a venue-aware and probabilistic model to assess team performance more fairly and effectively. It's ideal for modern sports analytics, forecasting, and AI applications.
